I am a research scientist working at Safran, the research center of [Safran Group](https://www.safran-group.com), a French multinational company that designs and manufactures aerospace and defense equipments.
I am working on ML and Reduced-Order Modeling technologies to speed-up industrial computations.

I defended my [PhD](http://casenave.github.io/files/PhD_Casenave.pdf) en 2013 and my [Habilitation](http://casenave.github.io/files/HDR_Casenave.pdf) in 2020. 

# Current research interest

* Physical Reduced-Order Modeling
* Machine learning for mesh-based data

# Open-Data for ML in physics

We constructed and published various datasets of solutions to physics problems on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/PLAID-datasets) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/plaid_datasets), in PLAID format (see Software section below).
Interactive benchmark are hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/PLAIDcompetitions), with detailed instructions on how to participate.

# Software

* [Mordicus](https://gitlab.com/mor_dicus/mordicus), a library implementing a data model for Reduced-Order Modeling
* [genericROM](https://gitlab.com/drti/genericrom), a library implementing non-intrusive Physical Reduced-Order Modeling methods, based on Mordicus' data model
* [Muscat](https://gitlab.com/drti/muscat), a library implementing I/O routines for fields and meshes formats, pre/post tools, and a finite element engine
* [PLAID](https://github.com/PLAID-lib/plaid) (Physics Informed AI Datamodel), a library proposing an implementation for a datamodel tailored for AI and ML learning of physics problems
